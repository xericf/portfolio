      <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an 18 year old computer science major with a 4.0 GPA studying at the University of British Columbia.
         Ever since I was 11 years old, when I wrote my first line of Batch code by studying Youtube tutorials,
          I was entranced by programming because it was the first time where I felt like I made something meaningful.
           Despite not understanding anything that was taught in the tutorial at the time and being subjected to countless
            headaches and code-related issues, I managed to push forward and create my very first program. From then on,
             I gradually developed my understanding of logic and programming by doing
              exercises on freecodecamp.com, leetcode.com, and projecteuler.net.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I have educated myself on numerous programming languages and frameworks: Javascript (React.js, Node.js, Three.js,
         React-native, JQuery, Mongoose, several Node.js libraries like Express.js, etc.), HTML (ejs), CSS (Bootstrap),
          Java (JUnit, Swing), MongoDB, C#, Python (NumPy), Lua, and Racket. In each new language, framework, or library, I always learn by
           constructing challenging projects, and as such I believe I would be able to learn any new package or language
            very quickly.
      </p>
